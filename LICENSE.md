## WhatsAScript as a programming language

Completely free. You can use it for whatever you want, even for commercial purposes.

It's a programming language after all.

## WhatsAScript itself

WhatsAScript itself, like, the code of the compiler, is licensed under GPL 3.0.

[**See it**](https://github.com/IQAndreas/markdown-licenses/blob/master/gnu-gpl-v3.0.md)

Note that an entire copy of the GPL 3.0 isn't included in the WhatsAScript binary (or even here since I've just linked it), but you can do `was --version` and it'll say that it's licensed under the GPL 3.0.
